# Sweepster
A minesweeper game created as a final project for GISC 3200 Python Class
###Abstract 
Sweepster was created with the idea of involving a player in an interactive game of Minesweeper through python code. By using a game loop with a coordinate calling system similar to the one used for the game Battleship the game was able to be created. The game exists with great bones to build off of to one day create a more improved interface. 
###What is Minesweeper? 
Minesweeper is a single player videogame with the objective of clearing all spaces of a board without selecting or denoting any bombs/mines. traditionally the game is more sucessful when clues about the number of remaining mines given after each selection. The game utalizes both chance and strategy based off of probabilty and origionated from the 1960. Information about the game was gathered from the game's [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)). 
###How does Sweepster Work? 
will insert how the game works here
###What Next? 
Sweepster is currently running off of a very basic interactive game model. The game runs great at it's current state however it leads its self to many diffent updates and improvements. Sweepster at its current state cannot be won. It can be played until a bomb is selected and the game is over. If I were to improve this game I would have a way to mark the bombs and once every bomb was marked and every space on the board is cleared then the player wins the game! Additionally I would work on cleaning up the board and improving the player experiance.

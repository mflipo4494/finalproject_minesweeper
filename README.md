# Sweepster
## A minesweeper game created as a final project for GISC 3200 Python Class
###Abstract 
Sweepster was created with the idea of involving a player in an interactive game of Minesweeper through python code. By using a game loop with a coordinate calling system similar to the one used for the game Battleship the game was able to be created. The game exists with great bones to build off of to one day create a more improved interface.
